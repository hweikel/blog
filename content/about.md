I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, where I studied English and computer science, wrote an honors thesis on the *jueju* of the Late Tang poet Du Mu, and served as designer for *Berkeley Poetry Review*, *Room One Thousand*, and the Brueghel Family websites. I now work as a software engineer in Santa Barbara.
