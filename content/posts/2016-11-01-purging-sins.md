Carmen Boullosa on Roberto BolaÃ±o, from [an interview](https://bombmagazine.org/articles/roberto-bola%c3%b1o/) in *Bomb* 78 (winter 2002): 

> From Mexico he acquired a mythical paradise, from Chile the inferno of the real, and from Blanes, the town in northeast Spain where he now lives and works, he purges the sins of both.
