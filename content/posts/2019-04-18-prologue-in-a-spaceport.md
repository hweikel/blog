Title: prologue in a spaceport
---
An excerpt from the introduction to Lars Gustafsson's *Det sällsamma djuret från norr (The Strange Beast from the North)*—a 1989 collection of short science fiction stories.

>To see the Lord installed in his flagship was always as grotesque an experience as it was impressive. A cylinder of nearly fifty meters in length and sixteen in diameter, made of a glistening black material that seemed at once metallic and ceramic, was lowered into place through a magnetic port behind the bridge at an agonizing speed by a pair of floating fenders. Despite its colossal size, the solar sailer Pascal II shuddered as the command module settled into place, as if the mass inside the proportionally quite small object outweighed the rest of the ship in its entirety. Was it the Lord or was it his vessel that was so heavy?

I translated a handful of stories, but it never went anywhere with the publisher; now, months later, sitting in an airport, I'm drawn to finish it by scenes like this.
