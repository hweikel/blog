Title: the moon we love like a brother

Lorde, “Team” (2013): 

> Now bring my boys in,  
> Their skin in craters like the moon,  
> The moon we love like a brother,  
> While he glows through the room. 

The boys are like the moon; the moon is like one of the boys. The successive similes bind them first in appearance then in kinship; and they operate fully within our scope of vision, like the light that spans heaven and earth, rebounding from one pale surface to another.
