Title: parade heist
---
Dusty, open roads enlivened by a medieval procession: groups of spearmen from different kingdoms charging endlessly back and forth under colorful banners. Daniel and I picked our way through the crowd and climbed into a university campus, covered with walkways and open trenches that led down into the HVAC equipment. It soon became clear that we had to use a barrel (infinitely large on the inside) to sneak out a delicate metallic object that contained everything we cared about. Daniel set the barrel on the ground and said “Watch this”: The whole building melted down into it like wax and we ran off past the spearmen with our prize.
